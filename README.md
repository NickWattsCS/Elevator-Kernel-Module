# Project-2
This repository contains two different kernel modules--my_xtime and elevator--and their respective makefiles. The elevator module makes use of system calls and multithreading to optimize performance.

The Part 1 folder contains a basic C program to demonstrate the number of syscalls made in a basic C program.

The Part 2 folder contains the files to make the my_xtime module.

The Part 3 folder contains the file to make the elevator module.
